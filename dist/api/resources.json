The empirical results indicate that educated, younger, and wealthier farmers are more likely to adopt alternate energy-based water pumps for irrigation. Access to credit facilities and frequent hours of load shedding are key factors influencing a farmer's decision to adopt alternative energy-based water pumps rather than relying on electricity. Alternative energy sources have positive and significant impacts on the productivity of wheat, rice and maize crops and on household income. The use of alternative energy sources for water pumping has resulted in the reduction of poverty in the range of 11-20%</p>\"\n}]",

The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of Ghana’s AMSEC program on various outcomes, using data from household surveys that were conducted with 270 farmers, some of them located in areas with the AMSEC program (treatment) and others located in areas without the program (control). The results indicate that the AMSEC program has had a mixed impact on different outcome indicators. For example, whereas the program has contributed to improving availability of mechanization services, reducing drudgery, promoting adoption of good practices, and raising yield, it has had no impact on the change in the prices paid by farmers for the services used and the change in the amount of area plowed</p>\"\n}]",

Column 1 shows that the GSRA had a large effect on the extensive margin of selling at least some maize: GSRA farmers were about twice as likely to sell maize in the year after the harvest as their control counterparts (74% vs. 36%). Though quantities and revenues are not significant, point estimates show increases in sales of about 20-25% on the control group. Of people who sold, Columns 4-5 show that GSRA farmers sold later (by about a month, on average, significant at 5%) and received higher prices for output (about 4% on average, significant at 10%).</p><p> </p><p>This paper shows that a group-based savings scheme can increase storage among smallholder farmers – providing savings clubs with a simple way to set aside maize increased the likelihood that a farmer stored maize by 23 percentage points, increased the amount stored by 17%, and doubled the likelihood of maize sales. Potentially this increase in storage could have a substantial effect on cash income from the farm: we find an increase in revenue of about 15% (though not statistically significant).</p>\"\n}]",

The Methods section gives a description of the statistical estimation. As can be seen in Figure 1a, the yield gain of Swarna-Sub1 is clearly increasing in the duration of flooding. While the estimated yield of Swarna-Sub1 is slightly lower than that of Swarna under non-flood conditions, there is a noticeable yield advantage that increases in the number of days flooded, up to 12–13 days. Figure 1b displays the treatment effect as the estimated yield advantage of Swarna-Sub1 (vertical difference between the two lines in Fig. 1a) along with its 95% confidence interval (6 1.96*SE). The estimated yield decrease of 180 kg per ha when plots are not flooded – an approximate 5.3% decline – is not statistically significant from zero. The yield advantage of Swarna-Sub1 increases as flood severity worsens, with a maximum advantage of around 718 kg per ha, an approximate 66% increase, occurring at approximately 13 days of flooding</p>\"\n}]",
